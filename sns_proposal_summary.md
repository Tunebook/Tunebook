# Summary

This is the Tunebook proposal for the NNS to create an SNS DAO. This forum post is an opportunity for the IC community to learn more about [Tunebook](https://tunebook.io) and ask questions.

# About

Tunebook's mission is to preserve Trad music, connect musicians, and provide a hub for sharing, discovering, and trading within the Trad music community.

Tunebook is a decentralized platform for Trad musicians, built on the Internet Computer. By leveraging the unique features of ICP, Tunebook ensures the permanence of its database of tunes, a seamless user experience, and a decentralized governance structure. The platform also includes a marketplace where musicians can buy and sell bespoke and rare instruments, with seller participation secured by locking Tunebook tokens.

# Proposed Token Distribution

Total TUNE tokens to be created: 10,000,000

Initially distributed:

- 25%: Treasury (2,500,000 TUNE tokens)
- 30%: Public Sale (3,000,000 TUNE tokens)
- 30%: Team Allocation (3,000,000 TUNE tokens)
- 9%: Airdrop For Early Adopters (900,000 TUNE tokens)
- 6%: DEX Liquidity (600,000 TUNE tokens)

Ledger transaction fee: 0.0001 TUNE tokens

# Decentralization SNS Swap

30% of the total supply of tokens is proposed to be distributed via an SNS decentralization swap.

Swap participation parameters:

- Min participation: 1 ICP  
- Max participation: 10,000 ICP  
- Max to be raised: 70,000 ICP  
- Min to be raised: 7,000 ICP  
- Min participants: 100  

The sale is open to anyone outside of the United States of America.

Participation is either via the launchpad in the NNS front end: https://nns.ic0.app/ or on the command line using [quill](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-To:_Participate_in_the_SNS_decentralization_sale_via_quill).
